Create a full-stack football turf booking application with the following detailed features and flows:

---

### 1. User Flow

- Users access the booking app by scanning a QR code at the turf location, which directs them to the online booking platform.
- Users log in using their phone number and OTP verification (using Twilio or Firebase Authentication).
- After login, users select the turf location if multiple turfs are managed.
- Display a real-time availability grid of 30-minute time slots from 8 AM to 11 PM for the selected turf.
- Available slots are shown in green; unavailable slots are grayed out.
- Users can instantly reserve one or multiple available time slots.
- Users can track their complete booking history within the app.
- Users can cancel bookings only if done at least 1 hour prior to the reserved slot.
- Each booking automatically generates a unique QR code stored in the booking history for easy sharing and verification.
- Bookings can be shared among a friend group via SMS or by sharing the booking QR code.

---

### 2. Admin Flow

- Admins receive real-time notifications of new reservations and booking requests.
- Admin dashboard displays incoming bookings with user details, turf, and time slots.
- Admins can acknowledge and confirm bookings; confirmation triggers a notification to users.
- Admins can cancel bookings but must do so at least 30 minutes prior to the reserved slot.
- Admins can view booking history, cancellations, and no-shows.
- No-shows by users are recorded and reflected in both user and admin booking histories.
- User reliability scores are calculated based on booking behavior, cancellations, and no-shows, visible to admins.
- Admins manage turf details, availability, and booking rules.

### 3. Booking History and QR Code Integration

- Booking history for users and admins includes all past bookings, cancellations, and no-shows.
- Each confirmed booking has an automatically generated QR code for verification and sharing.
- The same QR code can be shared with friends to enable group participation in the booking.

---

### 4. Payment Flow (Add-on Feature)

- Payment integration is optional and can be enabled by turf owners as an add-on.
- Initially, no payment processing is required.
- When enabled, provide a mock payment interface with card and mobile wallet designs.
- Simulate payment success/failure animations without real transactions.
